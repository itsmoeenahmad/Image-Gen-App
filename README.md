# Image Gen App

A simple and clean mobile app developed using **Flutter**, powered by **OpenAI Dall-e-3** model. This app allows users to enter a text prompt and generate stunning AI images instantly.


## Getting Started
- Clone the repo
- Make a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key like this:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
- The API key is already initialized in the main.py file to use this key from the .env file.

## Dependencies
- Flutter SDK
- OpenAI (DALL·E) API
- Dart OpenAI
- Dotenv (for managing environment variables)

## How It Works
- Enter a creative prompt like "A futuristic city floating in the sky"
- Tap the generate button
- The app fetches a unique image from the OpenAI DALL·E API
- View the generated image
- Download the generated image - only for IOS
